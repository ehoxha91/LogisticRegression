# Machine Learning

I have implemented few basic algorithm of machine learning, for better understanding the concepts that we use in our everyday life as scientists and engineers. I did not include any reference from books, papers and blogs. Most of the code is my work. I used sklearn datasets.

## In the first part: [LogRegression_LinRegression_PocketPLA](https://github.com/ehoxha91/machine_learning_from_scratch/tree/main/LogRegression_LinRegression_PocketPLA) 

I implemented:

- `Pocket PLA`
- `Linear Regression`
- `Logistic Regression`

For a detailed description please read the [report](https://github.com/ehoxha91/machine_learning_from_scratch/blob/main/LogRegression_LinRegression_PocketPLA/README1.pdf).

## On the second part [PCA_FeatureTransform_Regularization](https://github.com/ehoxha91/machine_learning_from_scratch/tree/main/PCA_FeatureTransform_Regularization).

I implemented:

- `multiclass logistic regression with regularization`

Also used:

- `Principal Component Analysis or PCA` to reduce feature dimensions
- `Feature transform` to see how the degree of the transformation affects the accuracy, overfiting etc.
